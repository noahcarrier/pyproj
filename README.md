## üìú Projects Overview

### 1. Project 1: **Organizdir**
- **Description**: Small script to sift through a single directory (no subdirectories) and place files in an appropriate new directory associated with its file type. This is meant to be compatible with generally common file types a regular user could expect to have in their documents. Ideal for organizing your desktop.
